# Insufficient Exception Handling in Asynchronous Dart Operation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient exception handling in asynchronous operations. The provided Dart code fetches data from a URL. While it includes a `try-catch` block, the exception handling is rudimentary.  The `catch` block simply prints a generic error message, making debugging difficult.  This can lead to difficulty in identifying and resolving issues in production.

The `bug.dart` file contains the problematic code, whereas `bugSolution.dart` offers an improved version with more robust error handling.
